# DSA-Design
For this project, we were analyzing and designing an algorithm for sorting course information into different data structures. The first part that was submitted was a runtime analysis of different data structures and how they behave when storing and sorting information. Through the work we did with these different data structures week by week, I felt an understanding for how these differnt data structures are used building. We worked with various algorithms that expanded my repitoir of problem solving in c++, and I feel better prepared to take on more complex challenges in coding and data management. I would like to go back and redo my final code that I submitted here to properly sort the courses when printing the full list, which was my biggest problem in completing the final project. I could convert the data structure entirely to a Binary Search Tree to make sorting easier at the cost of longer search times, but I also think that if I were to go back and thouroughly define what I need in order to acurately sort a hashtable as I print it, the efficiency would be worth the work. In working on this project, I have also gained an appreciation for practices in maintainability, readability, and adaptability of code. Converting pseudocode to code led to me using more inline comments defining what I was working on and overall better housekeeping habits of writing code.
